Hey! I'm Robert, and I'm a current Computer Science student at The University of Texas at Austin. I currently have an interest in Backend Development & Distributed Systems, and am actively looking for intern roles in the immediate future in these areas. 

At the current moment, I'm learning more about Distributed Systems by reading Designing Data Intensive Applications and taking a class covering Cloud Computing that largely revolves around working with data that doesn't fit in memory and machines that communicate via the network.
