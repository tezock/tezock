I'm Robert, and I'm a Computer Science Student at The University of Texas at Austin.

At the current moment, I'm taking a deeper dive into Computer Networks as a whole by reading Computer Networks - Top Down Approach :)

I also have some notes on Designing Data Intensive Applications [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h3aq_Ic3waq1mlfTA0s4wpD8YLDrzcP3Eg1sz0bkeJA/edit?usp=sharing)!

Overall, I'm interested in distributed systems, databases, and networks.
